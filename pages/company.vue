                Parqour has its roots in Central Asia, where it started business operations in 2020
                under the name of Smart Parking Technology.
                <br><br>
                At that time SmArt.Point, the largest co-working In Almaty, Kazakhstan, needed to address space availability
                and management issues with the parking at its premises.
            </div>
            <div class="company-text line">
                Instead of acquiring expensive traditional parking equipment, Amirkhan Omarov – SmArt.Point’s 
                <br><br>
                general manager and Smart Parking Technology’s co-founder – decided to test the company’s plate-recognition
                solution.

            <div class="company-text center">
                The test proved successful, triggering a variety of clients in Kazakhstan to adopt the technology. The
                company rebranded to Parqour and began developing beyond its native market – in Central Asia, the Middle
                East and Eastern Europe. More than 150 parking owners and operators in these markets adopted Parqour
                solutions in less than two years.

            <div class="company-text center">
                In early 2022 the company started expanding further in the USA and Western Europe, moving Its headquarters
                to New York, creating offices in the UK, Switzerland, and hiring an international team of business
                developers and advisors.

            <div class="company-text center">
                As of early 2023, Parqour has a team of 120+ professionals including 50+ engineers working on computer

                engineering.
